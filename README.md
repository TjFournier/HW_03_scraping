# HW 03

## Overview

My `ebay-dl.py` file downloads the first 10 pages (or how ever many I choose) of eBay for a chosen item and creates a json file for it. It contains items such as name, price, cindition, shipping, etc. To make it run, enter `python3 ebay-dl.py 'search item' '--num_pages=#'` in the terminal. `Search item` refers to what ever item you want to find. `--num_pages=num` The num refers to how many pages you want to download, but if `--num_pages=num` is not included, it will default to 10 pages. 


To create the three json files contained, the code would be `python3 ebay-dl.py 'laptop'`, `python3 ebay-dl.py 'Nvidia GPU'`, and `python3 ebay-dl.py 'red princess dress'`.
